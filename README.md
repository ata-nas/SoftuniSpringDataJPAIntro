# SoftuniSpringDataJPAIntro

This is an intro project to Spring Data JPA.

The TASK.txt file contains what is required for the project.

Currently, only stdout is configured for the result of the views implemented.
This can easily be remade to write the result of the queries to files instead to print to stdout.
